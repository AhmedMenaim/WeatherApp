# WeatherApp
In this project I have created an app using SwiftUI and I have explained each small point in the project in the below videos:

1. I have setteled the project introduction and how to start a new project in swiftUI

2. Here we knew the types our stacks, how we can use them and the differences among them:

3. How to create your customized symbols is so important that's why here we will learn how to customize your symbols and create them from the beginning:

4. After knowing how to create a sybmol and customizing it, it's now the time to be able to use it and check more features:

5. Let's try to wotk more and more on stacks and check how to create multiple stack inside each other:

6. We've seen how to use some components, now it's the time to see how to create a button and use it, also one of the most important things is (DRY) - > Don't Repeat Yourself, so it's time to know how to avoid repeating your code and do the best practise for refactoring

[![Weather App - How to refactor SwiftUI Components + Adding Button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26345314/168480706-61713c72-8b64-4e49-afee-2370d5e3e1bd.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prz1yyxjZt0&list=PLcqMcXfu9uXP-NorIWvjg_0zr-XQPh5eP&index=6 "Weather App - How to refactor SwiftUI Components + Adding Button")

7. After doing all of this staff you need to know how @Binding, @State, How to change to the dark mode & also how to use button action
